	<p>To avoid validation and compatibility issues dont forget to close all tags on your code. Today most of text editors come up with features that close the html tags automatically still, it's a good practice(and definitely for final check) to make sure that you don't miss any parent or nested tag which is not closed. In html5 it's optional to close html tags but according ton w3c speciification, you should close all html tags to avoid any validation error in the future. </p>
